# Contributing

First of all, thank you for showing interest in contributing, all your contributions are extremely valuable to the project!

## Ways to contribute

- **Improve documentation**: fix incomplete or missing docs, bad wording, examples or explanations
- **Give feedback**: we are constantly working on making things better, please share what features are missing and what is done good via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/filecoin-project/system-test-matrix/discussions)
- **Contribute to codebase**: propose new feature via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/filecoin-project/system-test-matrix/issues) or find an [existing one](https://github.com/filecoin-project/system-test-matrix/labels/good%20first%20issue) that you are interested in and work on it
- **Increase behaviors list**: we need as much as possible defined behaviors or annotated test in filecoin-project ecosystem (main priority is [lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) repo)

## Contributing workflow

- Decide what you want to contribute
- If you want to implement new feature discuss it with maintainers [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/filecoin-project/system-test-matrix/discussions) before jumping into code
- After finalizing issue details work on code, please follow commit convention
- Get a code review and fix all issues noticed by maintainer
- If you cannot finish your task or changed your mind â€“ that's totally fine, just let us know in GitHub issue that you've created in first step.
- Your PR is merged, you are awesome!

## Commit convention

We use monorepo, and it is important to write correct commit messages to keep git history clean.\
