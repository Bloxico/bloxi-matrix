  - name: Compute gas outputs
    behaviors:
      - id: BURN_ESTIMATE_GAS_OUTPUTS_001
        description: |
          Given the amount of gas used, gas limit, base fee, fee cap, gas premium,
          and flag indicating whether to charge the network fee,
          calculate and return gas outputs
  
  - name: Compute gas overestimation burn
    behaviors:
      - id: BURN_ESTIMATE_GAS_OVERESTIMATION_BURN_001
        description: |
          Given the amount of gas used, and gas limit,
          compute and return the amount of gas to be refunded and amount to be burned

  - name: Deadlines
    behaviors:
      - id: SYSTEM_ACTORS_MINER_DEADLINES_001
        description: |
          Given a sector is ProveCommitted,
          assign a deadline to that sector
      - id: SYSTEM_ACTORS_MINER_DEADLINES_002
        description: |
          Given a miner fails to submit a PoSt for a sector on time and doesn't declare the sector as faulty, 
          apply the "Undeclared fault penalty"
      - id: SYSTEM_ACTORS_MINER_DEADLINES_003
        description: |
          Given a miner fails to ProveCommit a PreCommited sector in time,
          apply a "PreCommit expiry penalty"
      - id: SYSTEM_ACTORS_MINER_DEADLINES_004
        description: |
          Given a miner fails to submit a PoSt for a sector and declares the sector as faulty,
          apply the "Declared fault penalty".
          The fee should be lower than the undeclared fault penalty.
      - id: SYSTEM_ACTORS_MINER_DEADLINES_005
        description: |
          Given a miner terminates a sector before its expiration,
          apply a "Termination penalty"

        description: Given a Message and a known Tipset key, return an estimated gas fee
          cap for the specified message

  - name: Gas Estimate Limit
    behaviors:
      - id: GAS_ESTIMATE_LIMIT_001
        description: Given a Message and a known Tipset key, return the estimated gas
          limit for the specified message
      - id: GAS_ESTIMATE_LIMIT_002
        description: Fails if given message fails to execute

  - name: Gas Estimate Premium
